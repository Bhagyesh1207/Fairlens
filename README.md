## ⚙️ Setup & Installation

### 🔐 Replace Environment Variables

Update the following placeholders in your `.env` or config file:

```bash
OPENAI_API_KEY=“<your-openai-api-key>”
COGNITO_REGION="us-east-1"
COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID="<your-user-pool-id>"
COGNITO_CLIENT_ID="<your-client-id>"
COGNITO_CLIENT_SECRET="<your-client-secret>"
```

### 📥 Installation Steps

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/fairlens.git
cd fairlens
pip install -r requirements.txt
python app.py
```

## 🔍 How It Works

1. **Company Onboarding:** Register your organization and set diversity goals.
2. **Resume Submission:** Upload resumes and job descriptions.
3. **Resume Parsing & Anonymization:** All resumes are anonymized before analysis.
4. **AI Shortlisting:** Candidates are matched using LLMs + diversity-weighted scoring.
5. **Diversity Dashboard:** Monitor team composition and hiring pipeline health.

---

## 📊 Dashboard & Analytics

- Live DEI statistics by role, department, and funnel stage
- Predictive analytics for attrition, gender ratio, and performance
- AI-generated insights for recruitment policy improvements

---

## 📈 Machine Learning Models

| Model | Algorithm | Purpose |
|-------|-----------|---------|
| Attrition Prediction | XGBoost | Predicts risk of employee attrition |
| Gender/Diversity Forecast | Random Forest | Tracks inclusion metrics over time |
| Team Performance | SVR | Evaluates team performance vs. size |
| Resume Screening | LLM + LangChain | Identifies top candidates & removes bias |

---

## 🌐 Real-World Impact

- ⚖️ Reduced unconscious bias in screening
- 👥 Increased underrepresented hires (by skill match)
- 📉 Cost reduced to ~$0.000075/resume using GPT-4o Mini
- 🔐 PII anonymization ensures candidate privacy

---

## 🧪 Empirical Study Basis

FairLens uses dynamic weighting logic based on:
- **Province-level diversity data** (e.g., Statistics Canada)
- **User-defined hiring objectives**
- **Bias detection heuristics & LLM transparency**

For example:
> *If the average representation of women in Manitoba is 48% compared to the national 55%, the diversity weight for women will be: 55/48 = 1.15.*

---

## 🚧 Future Roadmap

- Integrate with LangChain agents for job-specific reasoning
- Add feedback loops to fine-tune AI shortlisting
- Expand to multilingual resume processing
